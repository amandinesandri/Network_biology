Determining causal structure among variables based on observational data is of great interest in many areas of science. Causal models are much more informativethan probability models. A joint distribution already tells us how probable eventsare and how probabilities would change with subsequent observations, howevercausal models also tell us how these probabilities would change as a result ofexternal interventions. For instance, an intervention might be a policy decisionor action performed in everyday activity. Therefore, the effect of any interventionmay be predicted by a causal network and this ability for causal network topredict such them requires assumptions to build the network.

The goal of this project is to learn causal structure from randomly generated data, taking into account the effect of intervention or distribution changes and identifying the additional assumptions needed for the purpose of causal learning.
